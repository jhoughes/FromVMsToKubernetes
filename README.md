Presentation made to VMUG 2021 Usercons & 2022 VMUG Professional Development Event
The config files used in the demo are here, along with a shell script containing what I ran interactively during the recording.

I will update this README with a link to the blog articles for building a Kubernetes cluster soon, or you can check the [FullStackGeek blog](https://www.fullstackgeek.net)
